# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

Fir this week 2 also, I have decided not to put the code for the homework tasks in the journal, but write down and document how I completed all the tasks watching Andrew's Videos 2-3x.

But I wrote down code for each task on the notepad, and went over the videos again to check and then executed them.

Did commit them to GitHub as and when neccessary.


## Homework Review

Followed instructions from https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-2/journal/week2.md, watched videos, took notes carefully on the notepad,
went over the videos again, compared them to my notes, and finally executed all the tasks.
