# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

Decentralized authentication is a newer concept where users can gain access to online services using verifiable credentials. Say you wanted to access an online banking service. Instead of submitting ID documents, you could submit a Verifiable Credential from a government body to prove your identity.

This removes the need for the bank to request and store your information before granting you access. And you wonâ€™t need an account to login in the future since the service provider can issue a Verifiable Credential for ongoing verification. Logging into the site would be as simple as connecting your digital wallet!

Decentralized authentication is a method of authentication that relies on a distributed network of nodes or peers to verify user identities, rather than a centralized authority. Decentralized authentication systems are based on blockchain technology and provide greater security, privacy, and control to users over their personal information and online identities.


# Homework Review
